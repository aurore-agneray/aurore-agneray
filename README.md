### Hi everyone and welcome here ! ðŸ˜Š

As a curious person, I've always enjoyed tackling intellectual challenges, whether it's solving Sudoku puzzles or math exercises.
My higher education opened the doors to programming : **I understood that working as a developer was made for me.**

This experience led me to my end-of-studies internship at Capgemini for 6 months, and then to Eudonet as a technical consultant for 4 years.

:heavy_check_mark: **Today I'm searching for a new professional opportunity to place my skills at the service of challenging projects.**

### This profile is dedicated to show you my personal development projects. 

I'm currently training in the **React framework** and **TypeScript**. 

:heavy_check_mark: So you can find here below the project I'm working on : a complete web application to **manage my job searching**, with **a front-end part developed with React / TypeScript and a back-end part with C# and .NET 8**.

:heavy_check_mark: I added another project I worked on last year : a C# .NET API devoted to **get data about referenced books**, by their ISBN number and other criteria (title, author, etc). 

:heavy_check_mark: However I created it first with Node.js. I also developed a Vue.js front-end application to call this API. I'll make them public on this profile later. You can find the production version of this web application here : https://livres.aurore-agneray.fr
